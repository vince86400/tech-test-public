# Hands on tech lab

Welcome to *86 400* tech lab! This repository represents a small piece of the *86 400* code base. The intent of this lab is to provide an opportunity to get an insight into one's coding style, ability and thought process - also as an opportunity to learn from each other!

## About

A simple HTTP client to fetch JWT tokens from an IAM provider (in this case [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)).

This client is intended to be published as a private npm package that is then internally used by other services within *86 400* to retrieve service account JWT tokens.


## Getting Started

This code base uses Node v12.13.1

* Clone the repository
* Get the code onto an IDE of your flavour
* Run `npm install` 
* Run `npm run test` - all tests should pass

Take some time to familiarise yourself with the code base - openly discuss and ask any questions.

## Next steps

* Check out the branch `t1`
